This is a simple movie watchlist web-based application where a user can search for a movie he/she wants to see in the future. Details of the movie are fetched using an API https://www.omdbapi.com/. 

This application is built using: HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, JINJA2, and MongoDB

For future prospects, we can add movie recommendations if the user enters the wrong movie name.
